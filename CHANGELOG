0.1.3
- Fixes for `backpropagate_3d_tilted` when `angles` are
  points on the unit sphere:
  - Make sure each point is normalized
  - Correctly rotate each point w.r.t. `tilted_axis`
0.1.2
- Added reconstruction algorithm for tilted axis of rotation.
0.1.1
- Support NumPy 1.10.
- Allow to weight backpropagation using keyword `weight_angles`.
- Bugfix: backpropagate_3d with keyword `onlyreal=True` did not work.
- Bugfix: sum_2d did not return correctly shaped array.
- Code coverage is now 90%.
- Added more examples to the documentation.
