0.1.4
- The exponential term containing the distance between center
  of rotation and detector `lD` is now multiplied with
  the factor `M-1` instead of `M`. This is necessary,
  because usually the scattered wave is normalized in both
  amplitude and phase (`u_0`) and not only amplitude `a_0`
- Allow angles of shape (A,1) in `backpropagate_3d_tilted` 
- Set default value lD=0 for all reconstruction algorithms
- Update backpropagation algorithm formula in documentation
0.1.3
- Fixes for `backpropagate_3d_tilted` when `angles` are
  points on the unit sphere:
  - Make sure each point is normalized
  - Correctly rotate each point w.r.t. `tilted_axis`
0.1.2
- Added reconstruction algorithm for tilted axis of rotation
0.1.1
- Support NumPy 1.10.
- Allow to weight backpropagation using keyword `weight_angles`
- Bugfix: backpropagate_3d with keyword `onlyreal=True` did not work
- Bugfix: sum_2d did not return correctly shaped array
- Code coverage is now 90%
- Added more examples to the documentation
